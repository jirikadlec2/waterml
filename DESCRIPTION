Description: Lets you connect to any CUAHSI WaterOneFlow web service
    from any HydroServer. To see list of available HydroServers, see http://
    hiscentral.cuahsi.org. The package has six data download functions:
    GetServices(): show all public HydroServers from the HIS Central Catalog.
    HISCentral_GetSites() and HISCentral_GetSeriesCatalog(): search for sites or
    time series from the HIS Central catalog based on geographic bounding box,
    server, or keyword. GetVariables(): Show a data.frame with all variables
    on the server. GetSites(): Show a data.frame with all sites on the server.
    GetSiteInfo(): Show what variables, methods and quality control levels are
    available at the specific site. GetValues(): Given a site code, variable code,
    start time and endtime, fetch a data.frame of all the observation time series
    data values. The data.frame has two columns: time and DataValue. This function
    has an optional "daily" parameter, you can set daily=max, daily=min, daily=mean
    or daily=sum to get aggregated daily values. The GetValues function can also
    retrieve WaterML 1 or WaterML 2.0 data from a custom URL or from a local file.
    The package also has five data upload functions: AddSites(), AddVariables(),
    AddMethods(), AddSources(), and AddValues(). These functions can be used for
    uploading data to a HydroServer Lite ODM database via the JSON data upload web
    service interface.
