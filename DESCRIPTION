Description: Lets you connect to any of the 'Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrological Science, Inc.' 
    ('CUAHSI') Water Data Center 'WaterOneFlow' web services
    and read any 'WaterML' time series data file. To see list of available
    web services, see <http://hiscentral.cuahsi.org>. All versions of 'WaterML'
    (1.0, 1.1 and 2.0) and both types of the web service protocol ('SOAP' and 'REST') are supported.
    The package has six data download functions: GetServices(): show all public web
    services from the HIS Central Catalog. HISCentral_GetSites() and HISCentral_GetSeriesCatalog():
    search for sites or time series from the HIS Central catalog based on geographic bounding box,
    server, or keyword. GetVariables(): Show a data.frame with all variables on the server.
    GetSites(): Show a data.frame with all sites on the server. GetSiteInfo(): Show what variables,
    methods and quality control levels are available at the specific site. GetValues(): Given a site
    code, variable code, start time and end time, fetch a data.frame of all the observation time
    series data values. The GetValues() function can also parse 'WaterML' data from a custom URL or
    from a local file. The package also has five data upload functions:
    AddSites(), AddVariables(), AddMethods(), AddSources(), and AddValues().
    These functions can be used for uploading data to a 'HydroServer Lite' Observations
    Data Model ('ODM') database via the 'JSON' data upload web service interface.
